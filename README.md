# Overview
This project applies a Logistic Regression model to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on various features

# Model
Algorithm: Logistic Regression
Library: scikit-learn
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC


# Implementation Steps

Load the dataset using sklearn.datasets.
Preprocess the data: Handle missing values, normalize features.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the Logistic Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.
Evaluate the model using classification metrics.
Visualize results with confusion matrix and ROC curve.

# Dependencies

Python 3.x
numpy
pandas
